I am a Front-End Developer at [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) and a recent NC State graduate of Computer Science.  This site collects web-oriented things and thoughts.

In addition to the fun things I do on the internet, I also play guitar in two bands: [Less Western](http://lesswestern.bandcamp.com/) and [SMLH](http://smlh.bandcamp.com/).  I've engineered recordings for [WKNC's very fun Lounge Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO38eRQjqOBURmdsUp4dFwg), Nice Price Books and Records' Shows  and [Naked Naps](http://nakednaps.bandcamp.com/) one time.  I enjoy playing primitive finger-style and pedal-oriented guitar (Shoegaze), as well as krauty Bass lines.

When I'm not doing fun internet or music things, I think about leadership thanks to the [Caldwell Fellows](http://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/) program.  One time I was the TA for a fun after school program called the [Kids' Cafe as part of the Avent West Community Development Corporation](http://www.aventwest.com/).

Thanks for your interest and please don't hesitate to contact me,

John
