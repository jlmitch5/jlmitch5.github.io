I am senior in Computer Science at NC State, graduating in December of 2014.  This site collects some of the cool web things I have done in the past few years.

In addition to the fun things I do on the internet, I also play guitar in two fun bands: [Less Western](http://lesswestern.bandcamp.com/) and [SMLH](http://smlh.bandcamp.com/).  I also engineer recordings for [WKNC's very fun Lounge Series](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO38eRQjqOBURmdsUp4dFwg), and the ultra fun [Naked Naps](http://nakednaps.bandcamp.com/) one time.  One day I will play my non-fun primitive guitar music for y'all and that will not be fun.

When I'm not making fun internet things or fun music things, I talk about fun leadership things with [The Caldwell Fellows](http://caldwellfellows.ncsu.edu/).  One time I was the TA for a fun after school program called the [Kids' Cafe as part of the Avent West Community Development Corporation](http://www.aventwest.com/).

That's enough fun for now,
John
