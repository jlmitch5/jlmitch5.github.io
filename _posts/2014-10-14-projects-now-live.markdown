Hey,

So an exciting thing happened...this portfolio website actually became somewhat of a portfolio!  I've written a bit about each project, what I did, and what I learned from working on it, and I included links and githubs where I could.

While some (alright, all) of these projects were learning experiences and are in various states of hackiness, I'm happy to say I learned a lot from all of them.

One day I will sleep,

John
