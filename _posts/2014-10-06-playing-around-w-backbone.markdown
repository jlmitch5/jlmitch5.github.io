Sup internet,

I decided I didn't have enough JavaScript MVC frameworks in my life, so I played around with Backbone for the first time.

I went through and made a slight modification to the tutorial [here](http://arturadib.com/hello-backbonejs/docs/5.html)

The only real difference comes from the jQuery that instantiates the html for the list elements.

I did not like the one huge line rendering multiple HTML elements (ew!), so I separated the function that renders the HTML from the backbone function that renders the element (sort of).

You can check out my code [here](https://github.com/jlmitch5/backbone_tutorial)

Considering that this was my first time ever playing with backbone, this might be dumb, but I thought it was nicer from a semantic and readability context.

A group member's love of the Python PEP8 styling guide has really made me start thinking a lot more about code style (and how JS style can kind of suck sometimes).

Thanks internet (have fun today!),

John
