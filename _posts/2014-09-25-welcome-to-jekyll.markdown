Hey,

I have now added my fun resume to the web.  If you've ever gotten in the mode where all you can think about is HTML...I'm there right now.  Putting my resume required me to immortalize my whatever GPA on the net, but it's chill.

I have plans to do some content-aware highlighting once I get the portfolio sections done.  I will either hardcode this or make it Jekyll-y, depending on how lazy I am.  Either way, feel free to steal this paradigm shift of an idea once I put it up on github.

Here's to paradigm shifts,

John
