trimbl was developed using the MEAN stack to aggregate the posts of three great local music blogs: [The Bottom String](http://thebottomstring.blogspot.com/), [CityDaze](http://citydazemusic.com/) and [The Triangle Beat](http://www.thetrianglebeat.com/) for a tech entrepreneurship class project.


While this is still a work in progress that's been recently revitalized, the project made me realize how many cool things you can do with JavaScript.  I created the application and API routes using Express, made calls to the Blogger and WordPress APIs using Node's built in modules, and even did some operational project management using Grunt and NPM (through the projects package.json file).


I also got some more experience with developing my design skills through creating design assets.  I utilized these in the application itself, as well as for presentation slides I used in the entrepreneurship class.
