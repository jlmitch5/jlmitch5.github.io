I was the front end developer for the Caldwell Fellows' Online Decision Process application.  I worked mainly with Symfony2's forms (which are the best server side forms there are, IMO), and I added some jQuery UI features and HTML/CSS to the application itself.  My goal was to keep the application's design languange in line with the style guide I developed for the informational website.
