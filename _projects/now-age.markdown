For a web apps class assignment, we were required to implement a manifesto using HTML and CSS.  I decided to revamp Taraka Larson of Prince Rama's dissertation on music and existense, Now-Age.


I created a mobile-friendly single-page web "app" that implemented smooth scrolling via a navigation panel I created.  This wasn't a huge project by any means, but I did use the assignment as an opportunity to explore fixed position elements (in contrast to relative positioning which has become my go-to).
