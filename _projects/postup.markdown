POSTUP was a google apps engine application that I was the front-end developer for.  I worked with my friends Cameron Dolechek, Mason Morris and Monica Poletti as part of Duke's Hackathon in 2013.  Our goal was to create an online event site that drew visual inspiration from the event posters you see surrounding a coffee shop's door.


I worked to develop a mobile-friendly poster uploader using the Jasny bootstrap extensions, as well as an implementation of grid library [Masonry] for displaying the posters.
